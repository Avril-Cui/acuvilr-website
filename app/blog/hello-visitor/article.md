# Hello visitor! Welcome to my personal website!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm so glad you're here and taking the time to explore what I've built.

This website is a reflection of my journey as a developer, student, and creator. You'll find information about my projects, my experiences, and the things I'm passionate about. I hope you enjoy browsing through everything I've put together.

And since every good website needs a cute mascot, let me introduce you to Friday - my adorable bulldog! 

Feel free to explore the different sections of my website, check out my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you have a great time here!

Best wishes, Avril (and Friday)
